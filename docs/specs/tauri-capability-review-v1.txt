BitCup T017 Capability Review (v1)
Date: 2026-02-21

Scope:
- Tauri v2 shell for read-only repository browse operations.
- No direct filesystem mutation commands exposed to frontend.

Exposed commands:
- ui_head(repo_path)
- ui_list_refs(repo_path)
- ui_show_object(repo_path, oid)
- ui_verify_read_only(repo_path)

Security controls:
1. Command surface is read-only by construction and maps to bitcup-ui-api read-only methods.
2. Capability file limits window access to "main" and uses core default permission set only.
3. No filesystem plugin permissions are granted to webview.
4. CSP in tauri.conf.json restricts sources to self and data images.
5. UI state is path-parameterized and does not retain privileged write handles.

Residual risks:
- Repository path input is user-controlled; backend still enforces repo-open checks.
- UI shell build validation requires fetching Tauri dependencies in a network-enabled environment.
